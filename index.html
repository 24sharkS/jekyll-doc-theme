            <p>LinkSmart is a middleware for heterogeneous physical devices in a distributed architecture. It is a middleware which is 'inclusive' which means that it makes it possible to enable any device to be detectable and usable from a LinkSmart application.
                This overcomes the common problem of incompatibility between proprietary protocols and devices. It delivers development tools for application developer of ambient intelligent applications using such devices and also tools for device producers
                to enable their devices to be part of an ambient intelligence environment.</p>
