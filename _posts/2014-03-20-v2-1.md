The LinkSmart development team is pleased to announce the release of the enhanced and more robust **LinkSmart 2.1**, now [available for download](/redmine/projects/linksmart-opensource/files).
Our vision is to build an interoperability platform that facilitates the creation of cost-effective, high-performance cyber-physical systems and Internet of Things applications. LinkSmart constitutes an OSGi-based middleware for the networking of heterogeneous systems through loosely coupled web services.

The new LinkSmart 2.1 supports a **broader range of configurations** in terms of functionality, resource constraints and communication infrastructure, thanks to the improved modularity introduced in the previous version. LinkSmart includes now a GrandMessageHandler component to provide support for **unconstrained message sizes**, and a **new tunnel service** offers querying for services through parameterized URLs, paving the way for innovative SOAP-less applications.

In detail, LinkSmart 2.1 incorporates the following improvements:

* [New tunnel service](/redmine/projects/linksmart-opensource/wiki/Tunneling_URL)
* [New backbones for binary messages and for local OSGi services](/redmine/projects/linksmart-opensource/wiki/Data-based_communication_with_LinkSmart)
* New component for handling large messages * New handshake protocol between NetworkManagers
* Improved test coverage * Internal handling of message encoding improved
* Many, many bug fixes

The LinkSmart development team is working on more exciting changes to be featured in upcoming releases, such as:

  * Resource-oriented, RESTful APIs,
  * Support for structured networks, and
  * Switching to a Maven-based build chain.
